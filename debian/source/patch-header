Subject: Collected Debian patches for unbound
Author: Debian DNS Team <team+dns@tracker.debian.org>

The unbound package is maintained in Git rather than maintaining patches as
separate files. They are therefore all included in this single Debian patch.

For full commit history and separated commits, see the packaging Git
repository.
