Description: static library, header files, and docs for libunbound
 Static library, header files, and documentation for libunbound.

 libunbound performs and validates DNS lookups; it can be used to convert
 hostnames to IP addresses and back and obtain other information from the
 DNS. Cryptographic validation of results is performed with DNSSEC.

Package: unbound
Architecture: any
Depends: adduser, openssl, unbound-anchor, ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver
 Unbound is a recursive-only caching DNS server which can perform DNSSEC
 validation of results. It implements only a minimal amount of authoritative
 service to prevent leakage to the root nameservers: forward lookups for
 localhost, reverse for 127.0.0.1 and ::1, and NXDOMAIN for zones served by
 AS112. Stub and forward zones are supported.
 .
 This package contains the unbound daemon.

Package: unbound-anchor
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Replaces: unbound (<< 1.4.13-1)
Breaks: unbound (<< 1.4.13-1)
Description: utility to securely fetch the root DNS trust anchor
 unbound-anchor is a utility which securely fetches or updates the root DNS
 zone trust anchor. A copy of the current root anchor and root update
 certificate is embedded in unbound-anchor. RFC 5011 trust anchor tracking is
 performed, with fallback to an SSL fetch if this fails.

Package: unbound-host
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: reimplementation of the 'host' command
 This package provides the 'unbound-host' program that is bundled with the
 Unbound domain name server. This version differs from the one provided in the
 package called host, which is from NIKHEF, and bind9-host, which is from ISC,
 and has a similar but different set of features and options.
