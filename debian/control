Description: validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver
 Unbound is a recursive-only caching DNS server which can optionally
 perform DNSSEC validation of results. It implements only a minimum amount
 of authoritative service to prevent leakage to the root nameservers:
 forward lookups for localhost, reverse for 127.0.0.1 and ::1, and
 NXDOMAIN for zones served by AS112. Stub and forward zones are supported.
 .
 Unbound implements a number of security features, including chrooting and
 privilege dropping. The Debian init script will populate a chroot by default.
 .
 This package contains the unbound daemon.

 and has a similar but different set of features/options.
